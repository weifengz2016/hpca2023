The wide deployment of Machine learning (ML) and high performance computing (HPC) applications has been driving the ever increasing computing demands in both data center and edge. With the slowing down of Moore’s law, heterogeneous computing with domain-specific accelerators (DSA) is deemed as a new computing paradigm to meet the performance requirements.
<p>
  
Heterogeneous computing with DSAs brings many opportunities as well as challenges when scaling up and scaling out the computation power. At the chip level, with the advancement of packaging technologies, the heterogeneous chiplet architecture is powerful to solve the complexity of traditional monolithic design and the increasing cost of silicon process. At the system level, composable architectures with resource disaggregation lead to dramatic improvement of the low resource utilization which often occurs due to the growing computation horsepower within a single computing device and fixed configurations of various system resources.
<p>
  
However, how to interconnect computing resources and orchestrate heterogeneous computing with efficient data movement at different scales is the key to success. Another big challenge industry currently faces is lack of standards for heterogeneous resources to work seamlessly across various software ecosystems. 
<p>
  
The 2nd International workshop on the High Performance Chiplet and Interconnect Architectures
(HiPChips-2023) specifically targets the novel researches and industry standards on advanced interconnect technologies, and how they impact on the designs of chiplet-based architectures as well as software ecosystems. The major objective of this workshop is to share the ideas of technology innovations and the latest development on but not limited to the following topics:
  <li> Optical and other advanced chiplet interconnect technologies </li>
  <li> Interconnect standards of coherent and non-coherent data sharing protocols (e.g. CXL) </li>
  <li> Disaggregated computing architectures powered by high speed interconnect </li>
  <li> Chiplet architectures for in-memory computing and other emerging technologies </li>
  <li> Software optimization and scheduling with fast inter-chiplet network </li>
  <li> Power evaluation and performance modeling of chiplet architectures </li>
