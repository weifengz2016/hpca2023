      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> The wide deployment of Machine learning (ML) and high performance computing (HPC)
  applications has been driving the ever increasing computing demands in both 
  data center and edge. With the slowing down of Moore’s law, heterogeneous computing
  with domain-specific accelerators (DSA) is deemed as a new computing paradigm to
  meet the performance requirements.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-text-black"> Heterogeneous computing with DSAs brings many opportunities as well as challenges
when scaling up and scaling out the computation power. At the chip level, with the
advancement of packaging technologies, the heterogeneous chiplet architecture is
powerful to solve the complexity of traditional monolithic design and the
increasing cost of silicon process. At the system level, composable architectures
with resource disaggregation lead to dramatic improvement of the low resource
utilization which often occurs due to the growing computation horsepower
within a single computing device and fixed configurations of various
system resources.
      </h5>
      <h5 class="w3-text-black">However, how to interconnect computing resources and orchestrate heterogeneous
computing with efficient data movement at different scales is the key to success.
Another big challenge industry currently faces is lack of standards for heterogeneous
resources to work seamlessly across various software ecosystems. 
      </h5>
  
      <h5 class="w3-text-black">The 2nd International workshop on the High Performance Chiplet and Interconnect Architectures
(HiPChips-2023) specifically targets the novel researches and industry standards on advanced interconnect technologies, and how they impact 
        on the designs of chiplet-based architectures as well as software ecosystems. The major objective of this workshop is to share 
        the ideas of technology innovations and the latest development on but not limited to the following topics:
        <p>
  <li> Optical and other advanced chiplet interconnect technologies </li>
  <li> Interconnect standards of coherent and non-coherent data sharing protocols (e.g. CXL) </li>
  <li> Disaggregated computing architectures powered by high speed interconnect </li>
  <li> Chiplet architectures for in-memory computing and other emerging technologies </li>
  <li> Software optimization and scheduling with fast inter-chiplet network </li>
  <li> Power evaluation and performance modeling of chiplet architectures </li>
        </p>
